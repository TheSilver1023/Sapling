# Why Choose Sapling?
> Sapling is built on our [custom scripting API modules](https://github.com/SaplingDevs/script-api), giving us unmatched control over performance (Say goodbye to TPS drops!), scalability, support, and other key areas.
>
> But what’s in it for users?  
> For players like you and me, Sapling delivers a broad array of features—from simple mechanics like TNT duplication to advanced engines like simulatedHSS, and much more!
